## Sagebrush Steppe Applied Wildfire Modeling Project 

# **Objective:**\
This project aims to enhance existing wildland fire modeling frameworks, equations, and software by explicitly accounting for the fuel discontinuity characteristic of sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Current quantitative fire models are primarily built upon assumptions of continuous fuel beds, leading to potentially inaccurate predictions of fire spread, intensity, and flame lengths within the inherently patchy vegetation typical of sagebrush steppe landscapes. By refining these models to reflect the actual vegetative structure, this project aims to produce more realistic wildfire behavior predictions, directly supporting land and fire managers in decision-making processes.

# **Context and Need:**\
Wildfire modeling within sagebrush-dominated landscapes is challenging due to the inherent spatial heterogeneity of vegetation cover and the frequent presence of bare interspaces and discontinuous fuel patches. While widely used, standard quantitative fire modeling tools (e.g., BehavePlus, FlamMap, FARSITE) inadequately represent these conditions, potentially leading to discrepancies between modeled predictions and observed fire behavior. A tailored approach is thus critical to accurately represent fuel dynamics and improve wildfire management strategies specific to the Great Basin and similar arid ecosystems.

# **Data Sources and Methods:**\
This project will leverage vegetative composition datasets from the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment and Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), spanning approximately 2006 to 2018. Data from 15 diverse study sites distributed across the Great Basin collectively represent the region's variation and dynamics of vegetation types. These datasets will be integrated into spatially explicit modeling frameworks, using empirical and probabilistic approaches to adjust fuel model parameters, explicitly accounting for gaps, vegetation patchiness, and spatial discontinuities.

# **Anticipated Outcomes and Significance:**\
The proposed refined modeling framework will offer land managers more accurate, reliable wildfire predictions explicitly tailored to the unique conditions of sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Enhanced accuracy will support effective fire suppression, prescribed burning, invasive species control, and ecosystem restoration planning efforts, contributing significantly to the resilience and conservation of these critical arid ecosystems.
